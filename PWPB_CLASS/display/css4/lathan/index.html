                    I am fascinated by coding. It's everywhere! Every single one of the digital experiences we enjoy is the result of code.
                    But honestly, I know almost nothing about how it works or how the people behind the code — software engineers — do what they do. To find out, I spoke with Lindsey Redd. Lindsey has coded for some of the coolest tech companies in the world: Slack, Lyft, and now Stripe. She shared with me the details about her journey — from wanting to be a doctor, to studying computer science at Stanford, to thriving in the top echelons of software engineering. We also talked about some common misconceptions about software engineers, what it's like to work in a predominately white and male industry, and how to nail an interview for a job like hers.</h5>
